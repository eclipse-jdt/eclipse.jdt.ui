# JDT UI

This is the UI part of Eclipse's Java development tools, the user interface for the Java IDE. 
This includes views like Package Explorer and JUnit, the Java and properties files editors, Java search, and refactorings.

## How to contribute:

[Contributions are most welcome!](https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
There are many ways to contribute, from entering high quality bug reports, to contributing code or documentation changes. 

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by volunteers.
If you do not provide the implementation yourself (or pay someone to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed.
If it is a serious bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix.
